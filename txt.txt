//i have data that i want to transform between components not related to each other
so i'm gonna make service
// to call the api in
angular i have to import the http
client module
// to call the api in the service i have to make http client

//there is 3 scopes for the services provide in the root (for all the app) , in the component for every component , on in module for each module

// dependency injection بدل ما اcall ال class بشكل مباشر بحقنه من برا في البراميتر

//rxjs is a libatay to handle asyn
chronus and reactive actions (api) and inside it
something called observable (same as promise) and its a class inside the library

//to make reactive forms
1-import reactive forms module in app.module
reactive forms treat all the form as a form group and each
in
put as a form control

//ngsubmit prevent the reload that happens in the form
